# Hi, I'm Vyjayanthi 👋

### 🛡️ GRC & Cybersecurity Professional

I love building security programs that actually work—not just on paper, but in the real world. I focus on making them resilient, compliant, and aligned with what the business is trying to achieve. What I really enjoy is bridging the gap between technical controls and business risk. I help teams move beyond just checking the compliance boxes to truly understanding their risk landscape and making smarter decisions.
